## Machine Intelligence for Particle Physics
This is a repository that will contain useful code for the application of 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in particle physics  

Code used in allied fields of research are also welcome. We do not want to include all
of physics since the moderation becaomes difficult. However, if you feel that your code will
be useful to the audience of this repository, please feel to send a PR and we will take a look at it


---
__Rules:__
- The code can be in any language. For python, both scripts and notebooks are welcome.
- Code should be put in a self-contained folder that should contain the following:
    - __Complete Code:__ All files that are necessary to make the code work (including data files).
    - __README.md__: A README.md written in markdown format that explains what the code does and how to run the code.
    - __Data Files:__ If the data files are too large or publicly available, any link to retrieve them must be included in the code or in the README.md.
    - __Author details:__ The name and email of the authors(s) who will be responsible for maintaining the code.
    - __Dependencies:__ A list of dependencies that need to be installed (e.g a requirements.txt for python code)
    - __References:__ If your code has been used for a publication, please specify what papers to cite.
- The author(s) of the code will have sole responsibility to make sure the code runs/compiles with the files provided in the directory.
- Do not cross-link to other codes in other directories. Please keep the directories self-contained even if it means putting in redundancies.
- Running/compiling the code should not require the use of proprietary software (e.g. Mathematica or Matlab). Your code will be open-source and all its dependencies should be too.
- All issues raised for your code should be address by you.
- If your code has too many bugs reported and they remain unaddressed, your code will be removed by the moderators after due warning.


__Sumbission Procedure:__
- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch from the main branch of the fork.
- Add the directory that contains your code (following the requirements above).
- Add an entry to the README.md at the root of the repository explaining what your code does (keep it brief).
- Commit and push to your fork and send a pull request to the main branch of this repository.
- DO NOT send pull requests from the main branch of your fork.
